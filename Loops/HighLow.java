/*
Write a program HighLow.java that implements a simple guessing game High and Low. The program selects a random number between 1 to 100. The player than tries to guess its value. After each, the program gives a hint higher or lower. An execution might look like this:
Guess 1: 52
Hint: higher
Guess 2: 72
Hint: lower
Guess 3: 68
Correct after only 3 guesses â€“ brilliant!!
The program is terminated after 10 guesses with a suitable comment. Use Scanner class to take input from the user.
